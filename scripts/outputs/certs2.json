restrained and elegant language, Schematic is arranged in a predetermined mathematical sequence, yet the rhythmic progression through the forms via experience reveals an innate and intimate artistic gesture.\n\nSchematic was acquired by the Hashes DAO for its permanent collection in November 2021 from the Sotheby’s Contemporary Curated series featured alongside works from Andy Warhol, Kaws,
